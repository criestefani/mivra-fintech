# 🎮 Experience (XP) System - MivraTech

## 📋 Overview

The Experience (XP) system is a **volume-based progression framework** designed to incentivize frequent trading operations, encourage deposits, and create a sense of achievement through levels, badges, and unlocks.

**Core Philosophy**:
- XP is earned through **trades executed**, not time spent
- **Real trades are worth 20x more XP than Demo trades** (strategic conversion lever)
- XP unlocks features, tools, and Scanner access
- Badges recognize milestones and achievements

---

## 🎯 Level System

### Total Levels
**30 levels** from "Novato" (Beginner) to "Lenda" (Legend)

### XP Progression Curve
**Exponential formula**: `XP = 100 × (1.5 ^ (level - 1))`

**Key Points**:
- Level 1 (Novato): Starts at 0 XP
- Each level requires progressively MORE XP to reach
- Higher levels create "long-tail" progression (keeps users engaged longer)
- Max level (30) is achievable but requires significant play

## 🔑 Why Users Care About XP

### 1. **Feature Unlocks - Scanner Tiers**

The **Market Scanner** is a premium tool showing 30 assets ranked by profitability. But higher-tier users see MORE of them:

| Tier | Unlocked At | Assets Visible | Premium Benefits |
|------|-----------|--|--|
| **Tier 1 (Free)** | Level 1 (or any user) | 20 assets (#11-30) | Sees lower-assertiveness opportunities |
| **Tier 2** | Level 5 **OR** R$200 deposit | 26 assets (#5-30) | Better opportunities, notifications |
| **Tier 3** | Level 10 **OR** R$500 deposit | 28 assets (#3-30) | Elite signals, priority alerts |
| **Tier 4 Elite** | Level 20 **OR** R$1,500 deposit | **ALL 30** assets | Highest-probability trades first |

**Incentive Mechanism**:
- "Why climb to Level 20? Because the TOP 2 assets (97-98% win rate) are currently blocked"
- OR "Deposit R$1,500 to unlock all tiers instantly"

### 2. **XP Multiplier - Streak Bonuses**

Longer daily streaks give more XP per trade:

| Streak Duration | XP Bonus/Trade | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| 1-6 days | +0 | Base only |
| 7-13 days | +5 | 25% boost (25 → 30 XP/trade) |
| 14-29 days | +10 | 40% boost (25 → 35 XP/trade) |
| 30-59 days | +20 | 80% boost (25 → 45 XP/trade) |
| 60+ days | +50 | **200% boost (25 → 75 XP/trade)** 🔥 |

**Retention Driver**: Users maintain streaks to compound their XP gains. A 60-day streak user levels 3x faster.

### 3. **Status & Recognition**

- **Level displayed** on profile, leaderboards, and during trading
- **Badges** show achievement history
- **Rank** places you among all users

### 4. **Demo Limits - Controlled Progression**

Demo accounts have built-in restrictions:

| Phase | Duration | Daily Demo Trades | Mechanism |
|-------|---|---|---|
| **Exploration** | First 7 days | ∞ Unlimited | Learn freely |
| **Standard** | After 7 days | 20/day | Encourages deposit |
| **Deposit Boosted** | Varies | 20 + (R$ deposits × 50)/100 | R$100 = +50, R$500 = +250 |
| **Whale** | If R$1000+ | ∞ Unlimited | High-value players get full access |

**This creates urgency**: "I've hit my 20 Demo trades today. I need to either wait until tomorrow or deposit to keep trading."

## 📊 Progression Examples

### Scenario 1: Casual Demo Player (No Deposit)

```
Day 1-7: Exploration Phase
- 100+ trades possible per day
- Earn 100-150 XP/day (all Demo)
- Reach Level 2-3

Day 8 onwards: Standard Phase
- Limited to 20 Demo trades/day = 20 XP/day
- Progression SLOWS dramatically
- At this point: "I should deposit to keep progressing"
```

**Result**: Stuck at low levels, natural pressure to convert → Deposit

---

### Scenario 2: Real Money Player (Active)

```
Day 1: First Real Trade
- Earns 500 XP for "First Deposit" badge
- Maybe 20-25 XP from 1 Real trade
- Total: ~525 XP → Reach Level 2+ immediately
- Unlock "First Deposit" badge: +500 XP bonus

Days 1-3: Building Momentum
- 10 Real trades/day = ~250 XP/day
- Days 1-3: ~750 XP total
- Reach Level 3 (250 total XP to reach)
- FAST progression feels rewarding

Day 7: Streak Milestone
- +150 XP from 7-day streak
- 10 Real trades × (20 base + 10 win + 5 streak bonus) = 350 XP
- Total: ~500 XP for the day
- Daily streak bonus kicks in → level up faster

Day 30: 30-Day Streak
- +1,000 XP milestone
- 10 Real trades × (20 base + 10 win + 20 streak bonus) = 500 XP
- Total: ~1,500 XP
- Approaching Level 10 → Scanner Tier 3 unlock!

Cumulative (30 days, 300 Real trades):
- Milestone XP: 500 (first deposit) + 150 (7-day) + 400 (14-day) + 1,000 (30-day) = 2,050
- Trade XP: 300 trades × 25 avg XP = 7,500

### Scenario 3: Whale Player (Heavy Deposit)

```
Day 1: First Deposit (R$1,500)

## 🔑 Key Design Principles

### 1. **Volume > Time**
- XP awarded per TRADE, not minutes played
- Prevents "AFK farming"
- Aligns incentives: more operations = more revenue

### 2. **Real > Demo (20x)**
- Massive XP gap creates natural conversion pressure
- Demo feels "slow" after first week
- First real deposit feels like unlocking "hard mode"

### 3. **Streaks as Retention**
- Daily streaks create habit-forming mechanics
- Longer streaks = exponentially better XP
- Fear of losing streak = daily engagement

### 4. **Unlocks Over Cosmetics**
- XP unlocks REAL features (Scanner Tiers, tools)
- Not just visual badges
- Users feel stronger, not just prettier

### 5. **Deposits as Shortcuts**
- Level gates can be bypassed by R$$
- Doesn't feel "pay-to-win" but "pay-to-skip-grind"
- Lets whales show they're committed

---

## 🚀 Conclusion

The XP system is **intentionally designed** to:
1. ✅ Drive **conversions** (Demo → Real) through progressive limits
2. ✅ Maximize **volume** (trades/week) via addictive progression
3. ✅ Reward **deposits** with instant gratification
4. ✅ Build **retention** through streaks and badges
5. ✅ Create **status** (levels, ranks, leaderboards)

**The Result**: A user who started with 20 free Demo trades becomes invested in progression, deposits money to accelerate, builds a daily habit to maintain streaks, and feels a "long-term" commitment to the platform.

That's the power of good gamification. 🎮💎
